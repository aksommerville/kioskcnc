/* Injector.js
 * Generic dependency injector.
 * Injectable classes should implement `static getDependencies()` returning an array of classes
 * corresponding to the constructor's arguments.
 * A dependency "nonce" will receive some positive integer that has not been used before.
 * If the class has a true member "singleton", it will only be instantiated once, then shared around.
 * Overrides to singleton instantiation are only respected the first time it gets asked for.
 * Copied from egg2.
